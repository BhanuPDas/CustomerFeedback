# CustomerFeedback
This project work performs sentiment analysis on customer feedback for the product they have purchased.
Based on the review and stars that the customer has provided, the machine determines whether the customer is happy,
satisfied, angry, disappointed or neutral.

This project work uses K6 for simulating bulk requests, ML model (trainer), inference and an intermittent java microservice.
